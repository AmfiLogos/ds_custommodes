# Notes

## Where this repo comes from (2026-10-16)
- History = `git subtree split -P custom` of ds_multiplayer main 1c8f1af (40 commits, last 8a7c362). Tag `v13` = 8a7c362:
  its files are the same as ds_multiplayer v13 (29f0fa6) custom/ (tree 1f55b21).
- Scan of every commit (contents, messages, authors) for the owner's user name and home-folder paths: 0 hits. No binaries, no keys.
  Nothing was rewritten.
- 9019e18 = ds_multiplayer mpfix 30074cd (PvP: hook FactionRelationInfo.IsRelation too), applied without the custom/ prefix.

## How it is built
- The mod loader (github.com/AmfiLogos/ds_modloader) builds Custom Modes from the commit in its loader/cm_pin.txt:
  - Mac: loader/build.sh exports this repo at the pin into build/cmpin/<sha>/ and runs build_module.sh with
    MP_SRC = the multiplayer pin's src/ (loader/mp_pin.txt).
  - Windows: loader/modules/build_mods.sh puts this repo at the pin in place of the multiplayer pin tree's custom/, then
    runs that tree's win/build_win.sh (DSMP_TARGET=module).
- build.sh here = the same, standalone (MP_REPO, MP_PIN = mp_pin.txt, MP_DYLIB for the Mac link).

## Byte-identical proof (v13 pins: cm 8a7c362-equal tree, mp 29f0fa6)
- Mac: custom-modes.dylib ff1b4883..., custom-modes-mp.dylib 0e6c7b84...: the same bytes as the v13 release, from the loader
  build and from build.sh.
- Windows: no rebuild matches a release byte for byte: lld writes the build time into each DLL (PE TimeDateStamp), and
  custom-modes.dll / multiplayer.dll hold the build folder in quickjs __FILE__ strings. Built in the same folder, loader main
  and the cm-pin branch give the same 21 files once the time stamp is zeroed.
