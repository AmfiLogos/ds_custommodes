# Notes

## Where this repo comes from (2026-10-16)
- History = `git subtree split -P custom` of ds_multiplayer main 1c8f1af (40 commits, last 8a7c362). Tag `v13` = 8a7c362:
  its files are the same as ds_multiplayer v13 (29f0fa6) custom/ (tree 1f55b21).
- Scan of every commit (contents, messages, authors) for the owner's user name and home-folder paths: 0 hits. No binaries, no keys.
  Nothing was rewritten.
- 9019e18 = ds_multiplayer mpfix 30074cd (PvP: hook FactionRelationInfo.IsRelation too), applied without the custom/ prefix.

## How it is built
- The mod loader (github.com/AmfiLogos/ds_modloader) builds Custom Modes from the commit in its loader/cm_pin.txt:
  - Mac: loader/build.sh exports this repo at the pin into build/cmpin/<sha>/ and runs build_module.sh with
    MP_SRC = the multiplayer pin's src/ (loader/mp_pin.txt).
  - Windows: loader/modules/build_mods.sh puts this repo at the pin in place of the multiplayer pin tree's custom/, then
    runs that tree's win/build_win.sh (DSMP_TARGET=module).
- build.sh here = the same, standalone (MP_REPO, MP_PIN = mp_pin.txt, MP_DYLIB for the Mac link).

## Byte-identical proof (v13 pins: cm 8a7c362-equal tree, mp 29f0fa6)
- Mac: custom-modes.dylib ff1b4883..., custom-modes-mp.dylib 0e6c7b84...: the same bytes as the v13 release, from the loader
  build and from build.sh.
- Windows: no rebuild matches a release byte for byte: lld writes the build time into each DLL (PE TimeDateStamp), and
  custom-modes.dll / multiplayer.dll hold the build folder in quickjs __FILE__ strings. Built in the same folder, loader main
  and the cm-pin branch give the same 21 files once the time stamp is zeroed.

## Wiki Build Gallery: Compact Plus, List, Details (2026-10-17)
- Owner feedback: the cards looked bad, no Compact Plus view, no way to see a build before saving it.
- Views: Compact Plus (default, the wiki's Compact+: portrait + level, race / background / health / attack, worn items |
  trees | inscriptions | soul stones | acquired traits, then active | passive skills) and List (one line a unit). The
  choice is kept in settings.json (`gallery.view`). Click a card (or Details) = every unit in full with the game's hover
  cards (mu_icon -> mu_tip), Save to My Units and Test Fight from there.
- The list shows a page of cards (4 teams or 6 units in Compact Plus, 8 / 10 in List) with < page >; ">" on the last
  loaded page loads the next wiki page. Reason: the loader kit holds 1024 live widgets for every window and frees the
  children of a destroyed widget only at its next sweep (~1 s). A Compact Plus page is ~490 widgets, so gal_ui keeps each
  widget it makes and destroys them one by one before it draws again (and drops their mu_tip entries: mu_tip_forget).
- A one-line TMP text is cut ("Lizardman ...") when its line is taller than its box, even with room to the side: gal_ui's
  text boxes are at least 1.6 x the font size high.
- Names in the game's language: race, background, stats, talents, trees (TEXTKEY_*); build titles and pseudonyms from
  the wiki's words in that language (/<lang>/builds/words.json: fr de ja ko ru zh zht; es and pt-BR fall back to English),
  as the wiki's own gallery in that language.
- Data: list items now carry so (soul stones), aq (acquired traits) and x (extra stats); W.skills[k][2] splits active /
  passive. No live build has tags yet: the tag chips were checked with a local wiki folder (DSCM_WIKI_DIR).

## The game's text look (2026-10-24, 0.1.14)
- Owner: "Font inside of the units lab are not the same as the rest of the menus". Measured in a test copy (EN, DE, ES, JA):
  the font assets were already the game's (Lora / Cinzel, or the language's own faces), the MATERIAL and one size were not.
  The game's menus draw body text, buttons, check box labels and choice values with the body font's "OutLine16" material
  (FontMaterialType SoftOutline16: a soft dark outline, slightly bolder glyphs), section heads in Cinzel + OutLine16, and
  the title column's labels at 22. The loader kit gives its texts the font's plain material (the multiplayer windows' rule
  of 2026-10-13) and the Units Laboratory page buttons were kit buttons at 18.
- home/cm_look.c: the parts get a copy of the kit's table (cm_look_ui) whose text / button / toggle / value_row set the
  new widget's texts to LanguageSetting.GetFont + GetMaterial(style, SoftOutline16); window titles (26 and up) keep the
  title font's plain material (as the game's Options title), fields keep the kit's look (the game's name fields are plain).
  The page buttons get the stock column's 22 (cm_look_title_button); a label too long for 262 still shrinks (kit text fit).
- Test: home/test/look_test.py (one hidden copy; the game's own Options window and title column are the reference).


## My Units: team delete box, World units, snapshot (2026-10-25, 0.1.15)
- Owner: Delete team "Ask each time"; "My save / world units" so he can test things with his units; "save a snapshot of
  chosen units into regular my units, which can show time & save of snapshot". Design picks: PLAN_v013.md (ds_multiplayer,
  2026-10-25 lane dsunits).
- Delete team: a box inside the My Units window (the game's notice box has two buttons): Team and units / Team only /
  Cancel, with the number of units that go (myunits.c mu_team_split, mu_team_delete_units: a unit also in another team
  stays).
- units/mu_worlds.c: the worlds of the folders Load Campaign lists (DSML_GAME_SAVES = game saves, the modded game's Saves
  folder) in ONE list, no group headings (owner 2026-10-25, 0.1.16): one row per campaign guid, its newest file in either
  folder, newest world first; the CampaignSaveHeader is cut out of the file text and parsed alone.
  Our hub / PvP worlds, multiplayer temp saves and Test Fights worlds are never listed. A world's units are the
  Bring Units save reader's (mu_save.c), read only. Saves are only read.
- Snapshot: mu_snapshot -> a normal library unit + units[i].source (myunits.h mu_source); the card shows
  "<world> · save <time> · snapshot <time>" on a line under it.
- Tests: units/test mu_test (t_team_delete), units/test/save/run.sh (save_test worlds: newest save listed, filters,
  snapshot = the save's unit, save unchanged), units/test/worlds_test.py (one hidden copy, test library DSMP_UNITS_LIB,
  game saves = a folder with a copy of a real save; the owner's library checked unchanged).
- Teams on the cards (owner 2026-10-25, 0.1.17: "display the name of the team(s) the unit is currently in"): after the
  unit's name on its row, "Team: A" / "Teams: A, B"; the name keeps up to 55 % of the row; names that do not fit become
  "A, B +N" (no whole name fits: the first name cut with "..." and "+N" apart). Read from the library at every redraw, so
  Save as team, Delete team, Delete and Rename show it at once. A save's cards show none. 4 cards per page kept (in-card,
  no extra line). Test: worlds_test.py teams_check after each action (all pages, against the file).
- 0.1.18 (owner 2026-10-25): "there's only 3 units per line": the snapshot's source is now INSIDE the card, on the right of
  the race line (the race line keeps up to 60 %), longest form that fits: full line, "<world> · snapshot <time>",
  "<world> · <time>", "<world> · <MM-DD HH:MM>"; the full line is on its hover card ("Snapshot"). Slots are MU_CARD_H + 8
  again: 4 per page at UI scale 1 (a 4-unit team of snapshots on one page; worlds_test.py fails otherwise).
- "Rename team" (owner: "no way to rename teams"): a button next to "Delete team" (both only in a team's view), the same
  name box as the unit rename (field hint "Team name"), the team picked when the box opens (myunits.c mu_team_rename:
  the name only; units, author and gallery id stay). Bottom bar: the shown buttons at their label width from the left
  (layout_bottom), so the team buttons do not leave a gap in All units; pager 160 wide.

## Default unit names in the saves we write (2026-10-25, 0.1.19)
- Owner: "when importing units from my save, from the snapshot, they don't have their names saved": in a test fight the
  Multi-unit view cards (mod multi-bar) showed "TEXTKEY_PLAYERNAME_Elf_Male_13"; the top portrait bar showed "Silvarion".
- Cause: a save unit never renamed keeps the game's default name KEY (mu_save.c: build name = UnitNameTextKey). The game
  shows a unit's name through EntityDisplayNameExtensions.GetDisplayName -> GetPlayerUnitDisplayName (decomp 25846389):
  UnitNameTextKey is localized only when it equals DefaultUnitNameTextKey (or that one is empty); otherwise it is a typed
  name and shown as it is. A stock unit holds the same key in both fields (wiki base save). The wiki's savegen.js (Test
  Fights) and our pb_entry (Bring Units) wrote the race's "_0" key as DefaultUnitNameTextKey, so the key was shown raw
  wherever the game uses GetDisplayName, e.g. the stock unit panel (EntitySummaryUIView) and the multi-bar cards.
  The portrait bar reads the key itself (SubUI_UnitShortCutParts), hence "Silvarion" there.
- Fix: a name that starts with TEXTKEY_ goes in both fields: pvp_build.c pb_entry, and fights/sg_glue.js nameKeys() on
  the wiki's generated save (clan units only; a no-op once the wiki writes it). multi-bar needed no change (it already
  uses GetDisplayName). The library and saves are not changed: snapshot units already in My Units get their names.
- Test: units/test/namekey/namekey_test.py (one hidden copy, en + de; the Test Fights save from sg_cli and a pb_entry
  save; stock panel + multi-bar cards = TextKeyExtensions.GetText(key)). NK_OLD = an older tree: its saves fail.
